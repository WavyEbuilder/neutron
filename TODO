Bugfixes:

* module_request is no longer for sys.subj but kernel.subj since giving kernel
  threads their own domain. Look at the entire systemav and see what of it (if
  not all of it) needs to be moved into the kernel namespace. However, it also
  appears that systemd uses class system permission reboot, so possibly keep
  that in the sys namespace? (not the systemd namespace as the systemd module
  is optional).

Testing/CI:

* Configure and add sechecker workflow.
